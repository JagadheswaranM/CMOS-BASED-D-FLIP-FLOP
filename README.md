# CMOS-BASED-D-FLIP-FLOP
ABSTRACT:
  CMOS D flip flops are first preference to implement different type of binary counters, shift registers and analog and digital circuit system. In CMOS technology leakage power is primary significance.Toreduce power dissipation and to develop the time of battery backup,the supply voltage to the given circuit during standby modeshould be reduced.Modified SVL technique is applied to CMOS D flip flop circuit,which employs in order to suppression of signals and reduce powerdissipationdue to leakage currents in reserve form. Also theproposed design uses less number of clocked transistors, thusreduces the dynamic power consumptionas well as leakage current to accessible design. Each accessible design and proposed design is replicated utilizing Cadence device at 90nm and 45nm technology

CMOS D FLIP FLOP ARCHITECTURE:
  Flip-flops are the essential structure block of the digital electronics systems utilized within mainframe and most of several kinds of systems. Flip flop are electronic device that provisions position information. The D flip flop output pursue the input which provide the output as input.D signify “DATA” it accumulate the value which is on the data line. Flip-Flop is an electronic circuit which stores the rational condition of individual or extra data input signal are answer to the clock pulse. This D flip flop have set or reset during inverter circuit. There are two kind of flip flop solitary is single edge triggered (SET) and other solitary is double edge triggered (DET). Single edge triggered flip flop is straightforward and simple to propose as works on each increasing or diminishing edge of a clock. The architect of TSPC D flip-flop by 5 transistors is given at this time. The graphic of 5 transistors TSPC D flip-flop. This flip-flop is constructs utilized 3NMOS and 2 PMOS transistors. This edge triggered flip-flop is diminutive in region because it demonstrates low transistor count merely 5 transistors are utilized and it besides decrease power consumption. In 5T TSPC DFlip Flop, TSPC stands for True Single Phase Clocked logic TSPC circuit method utilized include single phase of the clock and evade skew troubles thus developing the performance of a digital system.These exclusion of skew involve considerable reserves in fragment region and power consumption. While CLK and input D each are grow then the transistors P1, N3 are OFF and residual transistors P2, N1, N2 are ON. The output turn elevated. Even as in ON clock period suchlike is the worth of input that turn output.
